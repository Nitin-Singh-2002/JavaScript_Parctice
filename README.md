# JavaScript_Parctice

**Here you will get Practice Coding Questions of the topics of the JavaScript.**

//Q.1 Temperature Check

  Scenario: You have a variable temperature. If the temperature is above 30, print "It's hot!". If it's between 20 and 30 (inclusive), print "It's warm." Otherwise, print "It's cool."

//Q.2 Traffic Light

  Scenario: You have a variable lightColor. If it's "red", print "Stop!". If it's "yellow", print "Caution!". If it's "green", print "Go!".

//Q.3 Number Range

  Scenario: You have a variable number. If it's between 1 and 10 (inclusive), print "In range." Otherwise, print "Out of range."

//Q.4 Day of the Week (using a switch statement)

  Scenario: You have a variable day. If it's 1, print "Monday". If it's 2, print "Tuesday", and so on, up to 7 for "Sunday". If it's any other number, print "Invalid day".

//Q.5  Check if a number is divisible by 3 and 5.

  Scenario: you have a variable named num. If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "Divisible by 3 and 5". if the number is only divisible by 3, print "Divisible by 3". If the 
  number is only divisible by 5, print "Divisible by 5". If the number is not divisible by either, print "Not divisible by 3 or 5".

//Q.6 Checking for a Vowel

  Scenario: You have a variable letter. If it's a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), print "Vowel". Otherwise, print "Consonant". (Assume lowercase for simplicity.)

//Q.7 Comparing String Lengths

  Scenario: You have two variables, str1 and str2. If str1 is longer than str2, print "str1 is longer". If str2 is longer, print "str2 is longer". If they are equal, print "Equal 
  lengths".

//Q.8 Checking for a Specific Value in an Array

  Scenario: You have an array numbers and a variable target. If target exists in numbers, print "Found". Otherwise, print "Not found".

//Q.9  Determining if a year is a century year

  Scenario: You have a variable year. If the year is a century year (ends in 00), print "Century year". Otherwise, print "Not a century year".

//Q.10 Checking if a string contains a specific substring

  Scenario: You have a string variable sentence and a substring variable word. If the sentence contains the substring, print "Substring found". Otherwise, print "Substring not found".

**Note: You have to create a JS file and code the answers of the questions mentioned above.**
